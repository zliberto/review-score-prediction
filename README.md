# NLP-based approach to review score prediciton
 
This project is based on a large dataset containing both continous and discrete hotel reviews. In this project, I perform a detailed EDA on textual and numerical variables to discover key factors contributing to customer review scores. Then, I attempt to predict customer review score based on the review's content and the inclusion of influencial keywords using XGBoost regression. The resulting model is nearly 90% accurate in predicting review scores. 

Skills applied:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* XGBoost
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Text Mining
